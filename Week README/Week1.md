# Week 1

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
    - [Test driving 1 project](https://github.com/KajaMaria/TDD_Ruby_Students_names_and_motivation)

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
    - [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/fvarnals/boris-bikes)

3. Follow an effective debugging process
    - [Debugging workshop](https://github.com/fvarnals/Debugging-Workshop)

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Week 1 at Makers Academy notes:

The first week was excellent. I now have a far greater understanding of Test Driven Development, how it works and why we use it. I have found that the discipline of using Tests to Drive the production of effective and efficient code pays dividens; particularly when confronted with more complex challenges, where it is invaluable to break the tasks and user requirements down in to logic chunks to be worked on piece by piece. This helps to keep my code DRY, adaptable and readable for other programmers. 

## This Week

-TDD
-Debugging
-OOD
-Pairing (inc Feedback)

### Tuesday 

#### Debugging Techniques 

 1. Best practice in processes
 2. Exercises - using refactoring and RSpec to identify bugs

 Process:
   - Tighten the loop -> Where is the loop?
   - Get visibility -> What is the code doing?
   - Don't change the tests until you know the answer.


 Type of Bugs: 

 1. Structure of the code : 
  - Unexpected Error
  - Name Error
  - Syntax
  - Unexpected/Expected end
  - Nil class
  - No method
  - Syntax

 2. General errors : 
   - Test Fails
   - loops
   - Stack error

 - Use "p"  to return a part of your code (console log).
 - Use rspec -fd to return descripitions colour coded by pass/fail to clearly identify failing areas of tests.
 - Use pry to interact with code to feature test and find bugs. 

#### Pairing 

1. Driver -> write code
2. Navigator -> direct the driver and conduct necessary support research

I find the pairing sessions extremely fruitful. Coding with someone who has a very different style, approach and ideas to oneself is an invaluable experience and is fantastic preparation for professional programming. 
 - Working with someone who is struggling less than you are, is an excellent learning opportunity and humbling experience. 
 - Working with someone who's struggling a lot more than you are, is an excellent opportunity to test and solidify your technical knowledge, as well as hone your communication skills.
 - Working with someone who has strongly opposing approaches and opinions to yours is an invaluable opportunity to practice patience, open-mindedness, flexibility, and communication skills.

I always try to understand the other persons approach and point of view, and learn from it if it's a more effective option, or guide them to understanding why I think it's not the most effective option/won't work if necessary. 

### Wednesday ###

Setting SMART goals 
  - Specific
  - Measurable
  - Achievable
  - Relevant
  - Time-bound

#### Good Plan -> Do/Practice -> Reflect/Feedback & Evidence 

### Thursday 

Reflection Session 
1. Successes
  - Understanding logic behind tests and Unit vs Fearture tests.
  - Better understanding of git.
  - Understanding of Gems, what they are and how to use them.
  - Better understanding of Object Oriented Programming

2. Struggles
  - I need to make sure I stick to the TDD process and don't get over excited and jump to far ahead without laying the groundwork/skeleton using TDD first. Although it's tempting to jump ahead, it can lead to falabilities and extraneous code.

3. Setting Goals/ Reflecting on goals from yesterday?
  - My Goal is to test and write another class for my TDD project

Marketing and Careers 

  - Don't think about finding the job until the very end :) Just focus on coding

TDD workshop 

1. Break down a problem into simple tests.
  - Turn those steps into tests
  - Use tests to TDD a solution


2. Breaking down your problem:

  Example: Working on Roman Numerals 

  - Don't think how are you going to solve the problem - breaking it down to classes and irb

  - You want to be able to give an integer and receive a roman numeral:
    When I input number 1 , I can see I
    When I input number 2 , I can see II (...)
    (...) When I input number 7, I can see VII
    (...) When I input 10, I can see X


  - Problem solving
   I want to /convert/ integer to /Roman Numbers/
   Why are you calling this test and what are you expecting to get back?
   Break it down and make it as simple as possible  and move one to the next simple step in tests etc.

## Friday ##

1. How are you tracking your progress?

  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What goals are you setting yourself and how are you going to reach them?
  - Are you blocked? - Is anything stopping you?
